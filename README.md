# API_Projects

I would recommend taking a look through the API documentation to get a feel for the type of requests we will be making within the example guides. We'll get very familiar using the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE verbs and pairing these with the powerful features of Postman.

All the requests that we will be making, will be included in a collection file, that can be imported directly into your local Postman application. It will start quite basic but we will be building these collections and incorporating features such as:

Collection, Environment and Global Variables
Preset Headers (Saving you a bunch of time)
Pre-Request Scripts (Writing basic JavaScript to create new data with each request and other cool things)
Tests (Chai style assertions)
In-Built Test Runner
Newman command line collection runner
Postman Console
Data Driven Tests
concept of CSV Config file 
Workspaces

Feel free to clone the repository with various API's . Hope this will help you to learn how to use API's in Postman.
